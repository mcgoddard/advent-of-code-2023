# advent-of-code-2023

Holding my solutions to the advent of code 2023 challenges. Learning go so trying to keep things readable rather than playing code golf ;)

In each directory simply run:

```
go run .
```

to get the solution.

Alternatively to run against the example input use:
```
go run . -example
```
